## Abu Dhabi
Welcome to our meeting place where travelers from all over the world receive a warm greeting and experience the respect of the residents of the United Arab Emirates.

Hospitality lies in the very heart of Arabian culture. Visitors today experience a welcome unmatched anywhere else, from the traditional serving of Arabic coffee to an absolute dedication of the highest standards of modern service.

Abu Dhabi‘s unique charm is reflected in the blend of ancient 19th century traditions and modern 21st century economy and lifestyle. Old world courtesies still prevail and traditional
culture is very much alive. Visitors can see craftsmen demonstrating ancient skills or experience camel riding, falconry, ayallah dancing, and henna painting, and can learn about age-old customs from local people who enthusiastically share their traditions.
