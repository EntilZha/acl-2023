### Humans Learn From Task Descriptions and So Should Our Models
*Main Conference Keynote<br>Monday, June 7, 08:00--09:00 PDT*

Joint work with Timo Schick and Sahana Udupa

Task descriptions are ubiquitous in human learning.  They are usually accompanied by a few examples, but there is little human learning that is based on examples only. In contrast, the typical learning setup for NLP tasks lacks task descriptions and is supervised with 100s or 1000s of examples.

We introduce Pattern-Exploiting Training (PET), an approach to learning that mimicks human learning in that it leverages task descriptions in few-shot settings.  PET is built on top
of a pretrained language model that "understands" the task description, especially after finetuning, resulting in excellent performance compared to other few-shot methods. In particular, a model trained with PET outperforms GPT-3 even though it has 99.9% fewer parameters.

In the last part of the talk, I will show how bias in NLP models can be addressed using task descriptions. Instructing a model to reveal and reduce its biases is remarkably effective and may contribute in the future to a fairer and more inclusive NLP.

Hinrich Schütze (PhD 1995, Stanford University) is Professor for Computational Linguistics and director of the Center for Information and Language Processing at the University of Munich (LMU Munich).  Before moving to Munich in 2013, he taught at the University of Stuttgart.  He
worked on natural language processing and information retrieval technology at Xerox PARC, at several Silicon Valley startups and at Google 1995-2004 and 2008/9.  He is a coauthor of Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing (with Chris Manning) and Introduction to Information Retrieval (with Chris Manning and Prabhakar Raghavan). Ever since starting his PhD in the early 1990s, Hinrich's research interests have been at the interface of linguistics, neural networks and computer science.
