## Registration and Presentation

**Q**: I have a main conference paper.  Do I need to register for the
conference?

**A**: Yes, as in previous years, you must have at least one author
registered per paper for the paper to appear in the proceedings. 
<!--- Unlike previous years, one author of each paper must register and pay
at least $300 for the conference. --->

**Q**: I have a Findings paper.  Do I need to register for the
conference?

**A**: No.  Even if you do not register, the paper will appear in the
proceedings. 
<!---  However, if you wish to upload a video, you must register for the
conference in some way (there is no minimum amount). --->
If you wish to
present the paper in any way (either via a pre-recorded video, in-person spotlight, or virtual
poster) one author must register for the conference<!--- and pay at -->
<!--least $300--->.   Findings papers presented at workshops need to register, at a minimum, at the appropriate workshop-only rate.

<!----
**Q**: How can I check if a coauthor has registered at the full rate?

**A**: Due to privacy concerns, we cannot provide this information.
Please coordinate with your coauthors.

**Q**: How many papers can an author "cover" with their full registration?

**A**:  There is no limit.

**Q**: I have not paid $300 for my registration because I have a D&I
grant or because I am a volunteer.  Do I need to change my
registration type?

**A**: No, this counts as full registration.

**Q**: I have a full registration and want to cover my student on a
paper that I am not a coauthor on with my full registration.

**A**:  This is not allowed.  Only a coauthor's registration counts
toward a paper's requirement.
--->

**Q**: One of the authors is registered on-site.  Can I use their registration to present virtually?

**A**: Unfortunately not.  We require presenters to be registered
  (both to support the costs of running a conference and to prevent
  Zoombombings).  However, you can register as a virtual student,
  which is quite cheap.

**Q**: I have a Findings paper.  Is it okay to only present at the
Spotlight session?

**A**: We’re asking participants presenting a poster in-person to also
prepare a poster for Underline because we currently don’t have a good
solution (both in terms of a physical space with the right acoustic
properties and the right technology) to allow virtual participants to
view in-person posters.  Having this available on Underline allows
remote participants to also view the questions and then ask questions
on RocketChat.

Due to the limitations of the venue, we can only offer a short
spotlight presentation to authors in person, but the virtual poster
session will allow for synchronous Q&A from all ACL 2023 participants.
You may, of course, choose not to present and not upload a poster.

**Q**: I need an extension uploading my video/slides.

**A**: This is handled by Underline.  Please contact them directly at acl2023@underline.io.

## ARR and Softconf

**Q**: Do all of the authors need to have SOFTCONF profiles?  Why?
{: .question}
**A**: Yes.  We use the SOFTCONF profiles to help identify conflicts,
so every author (not just the submitting author) needs to have a
SOFTCONF profile.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: Why do I have to fill out the COI field?
{: .question}
**A**: While some conflicts are generated automatically (from your e-mail domain and coauthors on papers), not all of these relationships are known.  It is your responsibility to list potential conflicts that might not be discovered by the system (the following is not meant to be a complete list): internships, joint research projects, journal editing, personal relationships, or new collaborations that have not yet resulted in a publication.
{: .answer}

---
**Q**: Does every author need to have a Semantic Scholar profile?
{: .question}
**A**: Generally, yes, any author that has any publications should
have a Semantic Scholar profile.  If an author does not have such a
profile because they do not have any publications yet (not even arXiv
preprints) it is okay to put "n/a" in the semantic scholar profile field.
{: .answer}
---
**Q**: I submitted an abstract with some authors without a Softconf
profile or missing information in their profiles.  Can this be edited?
{: .question}
**A**: Yes, this can now be updated.  Please do this as soon as
possible so that we can match reviewers to authors.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: How big can my submission be?  Why isn't it larger?
{: .question}
**A**: For the paper PDF, 10MB; for the software, 50MB; for the data, 50MB.  Reviewers need to download the papers, and not everyone has a strong internet connection at all times.  If you need more than this, consider using compression or lower resolution on images in your paper (for raster images) and removing polygons (for vector images).  You can also reencode your PDF.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: I just finished my work and want to consider submiting it to this conference. Shall I submit it to ARR in the Dec cycle or directly to the conference?
{: .question}
**A**: There are two ways to submit to ACL: through ACL Rolling Review, which is more like a journal submission (with the ability to revise and resubmit to the same authors and to "commit" to multiple venues beyond ACL, but with the cost of requiring more time) or directly submitting to the ACL program committee, which is faster but does not have the option to resubmit or to offer your work for consideration at other venues.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: I uploaded a file (e.g., previous submission) and I can't delete it.  What do I do?
{: .question}
**A**: Due to a limitation of SoftConf, it's easiest to just upload a PDF that just says "no previous submissions".  Sorry for the hassle.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: You told me to fill out a Semantic Scholar profile, but there's something wrong with it!  I had to reach out to them to fix it, and they said that it takes four to six days.
{: .question}
**A**: You can always update your Semantic Scholar on the global Softconf profile.  Please just put the best Semantic Scholar you can for you in as soon as you can.  Not having that information will make reviewer matching harder, but we'll do our best.
{: .answer}
---

**Q**: How do I set a corresponding author?  Can I change the author order?
{: .question}
**A**: These distinctions are meaningless at review time as we treat the authors as a set.  This only comes into play at publication time.
{: .answer}
---

**Q**: My research is unexpectedly awesome.  Can I upgrade from a short paper to a long paper after the abstract deadline?  What about the other way?
{: .question}
**A**: This is fine.  We need the abstracts to make sure we have enough reviewers, but changing the submission type doesn't affect the number or type of reviewers, so change away!
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: Can I submit my paper back to ARR after being rejected from this conference?
{: .question}
**A**: A paper may not be simultaneously under review through ARR and
an ACL conference. In addition, a paper that has received reviews through ARR and then separately receives reviews from ACL will not be eligible for resubmission to ARR, per [ARR's rules](https://aclrollingreview.org/organizers).
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: My paper was reviewed by ARR but I want to submit it directly to
this conference.  Is that allowed?
{: .question}
**A**: In order for a paper to be submitted directly to ACL 2023, it
must be inactive in the ARR system. This means that the submission
must either be explicitly withdrawn by the authors, or the ARR reviews
are finished and shared with the authors before the submission deadline, and the paper
was not re-submitted to ARR.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: My paper has been reviewed by ARR and I intend to commit to this conference; can
I post it to ArXiv?
{: .question}
**A**: In this case there are two anon periods: one starting a month before the ARR deadline until the reviews are received and one starting from a month before the ACL commit deadline.  As long as you are outside these two periods (e.g., you have ARR reviews and are before the commit deadline), you can post a preprint.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: Do I have to submit to SOFTCONF if I commit from ARR?
{: .question}
**A**: No you do not have to. Just commit directly through the same SOFTCONF system. We will make the submission page ready after the direct submission deadline.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: I want to commit my ARR submission and cannot find the submission link.
{: .question}
**A**: You can submit using the same SOFTCONF link as direct submissions but only after the normal deadline. See [CFP url](https://softconf.com/acl2023/papers/).
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: Do I need to submit an abstract if I'm committing from ARR.
{: .question}
**A**: No, that is only for new, direct submissions.
{: .answer}


---

**Q**: Can I upload a modified version of our ARR submission?
{: .question}
**A**: No -- we will use the original version and original reviews, since there will be no separate reviewing process for ARR comissions.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: The PDF file for ARR committment should contain the full paper or just the limiation and rebuttal sections?
{: .question}
**A**: It should only contain the limitation and rebuttal sections.
{: .answer}


## Paper Formatting


**Q**: Why does my draft not pass the formatting test by using the standard conference template and ACL Pubcheck?
{: .question}

**A**: For using the verification script, one should *not* use the review
mode.  More concretely, the validation script checks to make sure that
there's nothing in the margins.  The extra numbers to aid reviewing
violates the checker.  After you pass the check, make sure you turn it back to the review mode.  Otherwise, your paper will be desk rejected.
{: .answer}

**Q**: I uploaded a paper not using the review mode, here's a version
with review mode on.  Can you upload that for me? 
{: .question}

**A**: Unfortunately, we can't easily verify that the two PDFs have the same content.  And it certainly would not be viable to for the unpaid volunteers to allow uploads for all five thousand submissions.  
{: .answer}

**Q**: Do reviewers actually need the review mode? 
{: .question}

**A**: Yes, it makes the review process smoother to be able to
directly refer to specific positions in the paper.  Thus, it is a
required part of the submission process.
{: .answer}


---

**Q**: If I commit from ARR, what is the page limit of my rebuttal file?
{: .question}
**A**: We require that the rebuttal file does not exceed one page using the standard template.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: I forgot to add Limitations to my submission, can you add this?
{: .question}
**A**: Sorry, we have decided that all submissions without Limitations will be desk rejected
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: I got the error: The page size of this PDF is different from A4, which is not allowed by the submission guidelines.
{: .question}
**A**: First, make sure you are using the official submission templates.  If
you are not, this problem is typically the result of using "Print to PDF"
(e.g., from the Word template) and
specifying a different page size other than A4.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: Can I use LaTeX package "foobar"?
{: .question}
**A**: We have no specific guidelines beyond those in the formatting
instructions, and there are no disallowed packages per se.  However, do not do anything that circumvents the spirit of the formatting guidelines by changing line spacing, font size, font family, etc. to unfairly fit text into a submission.  Such submissions can be rejected.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: Can you look over my submission to make sure it's okay?
{: .question}
**A**: Sorry, as unpaid volunteers we do not have the bandwidth to
individually check all presubmission files for compliance, and it would be unfair
to do this for some submissions but not others.  Please carefully follow the
directions, check the FAQs, and ask your colleagues for advice.  We will
update this FAQ as we get new questions about submission.  You can
check your submitted files by logging into Softconf.
{: .answer}

## Reviewing

**Q**: I am a reviewer and I want to reduce my review load / change my assigned submissions/ tell my unavailability dates.
{: .question}
**A**: Kindly contact your senior area chairs for taking necessary actions.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: Some of our authors are ACs, but the submission form asks to
confirm that at least one of the authors is a reviewer.
{: .question}
**A**: Serving as an AC (or SAC) counts as reviewing activity.
{: .answer}


## Dual Submissions

**Q**: Can I submit my work to another conference or submit work that is currently under review elsewhere (e.g. at EACL)?
{: .question}
**A**: EACL's notification deadline is right after ACL's submission
deadline.  If you withdraw your paper within 24 hours of the other
conference's notification (assuming it is accepted), this brief period
of double submission is acceptable.  No other double submissions are
allowed. 
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: What about papers rejected from AISTATS?  Its notification
deadline is before the submission deadline?
{: .question}
**A**: We do not count this as a dual submission, as the notification
is before the deadline.  However, if the paper is accepted to AISTATS,
you must of course withdraw the submission from this conference?
{: .answer}

---


**Q**: What about papers rejected from AISTATS?  Its notification deadline is Jan 19?
{: .question}
**A**: We do not count this as a dual submission, as the notification is before the deadline.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: What about WWW?  It has a similar deadline as EACL.
{: .question}
**A**: We made a special exception for the EACL withdrawal deadline to
be later after extensive negotiations because of the very large
overlap in community and because we have access to information.  We
cannot have special cases for all conferences.  If you withdraw your
paper before the ACL deadline, however, then it of course does not
count as a dual submission.
{: .answer}

---


**Q**: Can dual I submit my work to a non-archival workshop?
{: .question}

**A**: Yes, however, make sure that this does not violate the
anonymity policy by making a new revision of your paper available
online. 
{: .answer}

## Anonymity/Non-Archival

**Q**: Is it OK to withdraw my paper from ICLR and submit to this conference?
{: .question}

**A**: If a non-anonymous version of the paper was made publicly available
before the ACL 2023 anonymity period, it is OK to withdraw from ICLR
and submit to ACL. However, if de-anonymization on withdrawal results
in the paper being de-anonymized for the first time,  the paper would
violate the ACL anonymity policies.  As all submitted papers (accepted
or rejected) will be deanonymized after the notification, this applies
even if the paper was rejected from ICLR.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: Is this consistent with previous ACL policy on ICLR
anonymization? 

**A**: We are following the policy set forth by (ACL
2021)[https://2021.aclweb.org/blog/paper-submission-faqs/], which
allowed de-anonymization within the ACL anonymity period so long as it
was previously released outside the period.

**Q**: Is it OK to talk about my work (e.g. at a workshop) during the anonymity period?
{: .question}

**A**: Yes, you can talk in small venues about your work, but be careful not to publish a non-anonymized draft of the work and please do not publicize it widely (e.g. on social media).
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: Does submitting to a leaderboard violate anonymity?  Can I link
to the leaderboard?
{: .question}

**A**: It depends on how you name your leaderboard entry and what
information the leaderboard makes public.  If your leaderboard shows
your institution, e-mail, or real-life name, then pointing to the
leaderboard would violate anonymity (you can still report the score in
the paper, though).  If the leaderboard just has the name of the model
(which is independent of your institution), then there is no problem.

However, model names should be "new"; if you previously published the
model FizzBuzz, the leaderboard entry should not be FizzBuzz 2.0.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: My paper is no longer under review at ARR but I plan to commit it to
this conference, can I post it to ArXiv?
{: .question}

**A**: As long as it is a month before the commit deadline, you may post
a non-anonymous copy on the web.
{: .answer}

---

**Q**: Can I dual-submit my work to a conference/workshop where the work will be included in non-refereed proceedings volumes?
{: .question}

**A**: Yes. However, make sure that you do not post a preprint by
yourself. In addition, you are asked not to advertise a non-anonymous
preprint on social media or take other actions that would further
compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period. See the
"Submission" section of [ACL Policies for Submission, Review and
Citation](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation) 
{: .answer}


## Virtual Attendance

**Q**: Would I be able to present my paper virtually at the main conference and the workshops? Would I be able to participate in the conference virtually?
{: .question}

**A**: Yes, while we are still finalizing the format of the conference, all participants will have the option to attend virtually.
{: .answer}

<!---------


## Deadline

**Q**: I am very sorry that we missed the deadline, because of something that we could not foresee. 
{: .question}
**A**: We have decdied not to allow late submissions in order to be fair for those who did not write to us. Close to the deadline there was a system breakdown at SOFTCONF which caused slow traffic. We contacted the SOFTCONF team and extended the submission time by several hours after the system was restored. We are sorry if you miss the deadline but wish that you plan early and submit to a next conference!
