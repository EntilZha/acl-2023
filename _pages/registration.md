Based on feedback from our members, all papers in the program (oral or poster) must have at least one author who has registered at the appropriate rate for their presentation modality and status (e.g. virtual or in-person, student or regular, full conference or workshop only), without a fixed minimum. However please note that all in-person attendees must register for the conference at the in-person rates, and virtual (Underline platform) credentials should not be shared. Thus all virtual presenters should also be registered individually (at student or regular rates, as appropriate). Findings papers only appearing in the proceedings need not have someone register, but Findings papers presented in any way, including as virtual posters or spotlight talks, should register at the appropriate in-person or virtual rate of the presenter. If any of the above would cause financial hardship, please apply for D&I subsidies including discounted or free virtual registration using the link in the virtual registration section below.

**The Full Conference In-person Registration Fee Includes:**

* Admission to all in-person Meeting sessions and the exhibition as well as the entire virtual program
* Conference Bag and Materials
* Tea and coffee breaks throughout the Meeting
* Admission to the Welcome Reception on Sunday 9th of July at The Westin Harbour Castle, Metropolitan Ballroom including light canapes and a welcome drink.
* Admission to the Social Dinner on Tuesday 11th July at The Steam Whistle Brewer, including buffet dinner.
* Attendance to all recorded sessions on demand for at least one month following the Meeting.

**The Full Conference Virtual Registration Fee Includes:**

* Attendance to all Meeting sessions via the virtual conference platform
* Access to online poster gallery
* Access to online networking opportunities
* Attendance to all recorded sessions on demand for at least one month following the Meeting.
 
**Note that:**

* Early registration will end on Sunday, June 18, 2023, 11:59 PM (EDT).
* Late registration starts Monday, June 19 and ends Friday, July 7, 2023, 11:59 PM (EDT).
* On-site registration begins Saturday, July 8, 2023.  
* Bring a copy of your registration confirmation to Registration Check-in to pick up your badge.
* If your plans change and you had selected virtual attendance but now want to attend in person, please contact Yes Events (below) to make the change and pay the difference owed.  Similarly, if you cannot attend in person as you had registered, by contacting Yes Events, you may change to virtual and receive a refund for the difference (**fees may apply**).

## In- Person Pricing 

Each main conference paper must have at least one registered author (either in
person or virtual). If this is prohibitive, please contact the D&I committee.
Findings papers have optional virtual presentations and optional in-person
spotlights.  If you elect to take advantage of these presentation
opportunities, at least one author of the Findings paper must register.

If you are presenting at a workshop, you do not need to register for the main
conference, but you must register for the appropriate workshop.

## Virtual Pricing

For a Discounted/sliding scale Virtual Registration Subsidy ($0-100), apply [here](discounted_virtual_registration).

Given the large real costs of all conference paper presentations
(whether virtual or in-person), all papers in the program (oral or
poster) must have at least one author who has registered. If this is
prohibitive, please contact the D&I committee.
