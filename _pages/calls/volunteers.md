A limited number of student volunteers are needed for the success of The 61st Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2023). Both online and in-person event volunteers are needed.

In exchange for one full day equivalent of work, students receive free registration to the main conference, workshops and tutorials, and the social events. The work will be divided, probably into two half-day shifts, and the shifts will be scheduled to maximize volunteer access to the conference events.

Tasks may include assisting at the registration desk, filling delegate packs, managing poster board sessions and displays, serving as volunteer coordinator for the day, and/or AV/technical support such as (but not limited to) managing social media (Twitter) and providing assistance for conference events including tutorials, the main conference, and workshops (either online or in-person versions).

## Important Dates


All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 ("anywhere on Earth").

| Notification of Acceptance | June 5, 2023 |

## Selection Criteria

Applicants for the Student Volunteer Program will be evaluated based on the material submitted in the application package (see below for the submission requirements). Preference will be given to students who are presenting a paper (in-person) at the main conference or any of the associated workshops and do not have other means of travel support.

## Submission Procedure

Applicants for the Student Volunteer Program must be full-time students and should submit the completed application form where we ask a few questions and a one-page CV (resume). Students should make travel arrangements and accommodations independent of the results of the application.

**Please DO NOT REGISTER** for the ACL 2023 Conference until someone has reached out to you or you have received a Congratulatory email confirming your Volunteer Service Acceptance. Once you have received this Acceptance notification you will receive a special link to register in which your registration fees are waived. Additionally, a separate email containing a Volunteer Registration form will be sent to you, in which you can list what volunteer preference task you would like based on your skillset (i.e. registration, volunteer coordinator, poster session liaison etc.). This form must be completed FIRST in order to receive the ACL Conference 2023 LINK to have registration fees waived. If for any reason you are not accepted, the Registrar will work with you to secure early registration fee rates.
In the case that a student requires reimbursement after the conference for LATE volunteer registration, the student must provide receipt of paid registration fees from debit or bank account (i.e., a business expense report) to the ACL Assistant Director of Events, Megs Haddad ([acl.megshaddad@gmail.com](mailto:acl.megshaddad@gmail.com)).

Students are required to fill out the Volunteer Reimbursement Form that will be available once selected. In this form, please attach proof of all receipts to be refunded. Preferred refund method for in person conference attendance is Cash at the event (if the form is complete and all receipts are turned in). If this is not possible, a valid mailing address is required to receive a reimbursement check, a valid email address required for PayPal payments, or complete banking details to receive a wire reimbursement (only in the event that check reimbursement is not possible).
