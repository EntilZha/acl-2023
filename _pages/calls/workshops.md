The Association for Computational Linguistics invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with EACL 2023, ACL 2023, or EMNLP 2023. We solicit proposals in all areas of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines such as linguistics, speech, information retrieval, and multimodal processing.

Workshops will be held at one of the following conference venues:

* [EACL 2023](https://2023.eacl.org) (The 17th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics) will be a hybrid conference, and physically held in Dubrovnik, Croatia from May 2-6, 2023.
* [ACL 2023](https://2023.aclweb.org) (The 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics) will be a hybrid conference, and physically held in Toronto, Canada from July 9-14, 2023.
* EMNLP 2023 (The 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing) TBA

The workshop co-chairs will work together to assign workshops to the three conferences. They will take into account location preferences and technical constraints provided by the workshop proposers.

All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 ("anywhere on Earth").

## Submission Information

Proposals should be submitted as PDF documents. Note that submissions should be ready to be turned into a Call for Papers to the workshop within one week of notification.

The proposals should be at most two pages for the main proposal and at most two additional pages for information about the organizers, program committee, and references. Thus, the whole proposal should not be more than four pages long.

The two pages for the main proposal must include:

- A title and a brief description of the workshop topic and content.
- A list of invited speakers, if applicable, with an indication of which ones have already agreed and which are indicative, and sources of funding for the speakers.
- An estimate of the number of attendees.
- Depending on the global situation of COVID-19, some conferences might take place only virtually. We request submissions to contain a brief discussion on measures planned to make sure a workshop is successful and productive in case of a virtual-only attendance.
- A description of any shared tasks associated with the workshop, and estimate of the number of participants.
- A description of special requirements and technical needs.
- The preferred venue(s) (EACL / ACL / EMNLP), if any, and description of any constraints (e.g., if the workshop is compatible with only one of these events, logistically, thematically or otherwise)
- If the workshop has been held before, a note specifying where previous workshops were held, how many submissions the workshop received, how many papers were accepted (also specify if they were not regular papers, e.g., shared task system description papers), and how many attendees the workshop attracted.

Note that the only financial support available to workshops is a single free workshop registration for an invited speaker. The workshop organizers must bear all other costs independently.

The two pages for information about organizers, program committee, and references must include:

- The names, affiliations, and email addresses of the organizers, with a brief statement (2-5 sentences) of their research interests, areas of expertise, and experience in organizing workshops and related events.
- A list of Program Committee members, with an indication of which members have already agreed. Organizers should do their best to estimate the number of submissions (especially for recurring workshops) in order to (a) ensure a sufficient number of reviewers so that each paper receives 3 reviews, and (b) anticipate that no one is committed to reviewing more than 3 papers. This practice is likely to ensure on-time and thoughtful reviews.
- An indication whether the workshop will consider papers submitted through ACL Rolling Review (ARR); an indication whether the workshop will use OpenReview as a platform (both to take papers from ARR and for their own review); whether the workshop will only use START as a platform, and will not use ARR. In making this choice, please pay careful attention to the ARR deadlines and conference notifications.

Submission is electronic at the following link: [https://softconf.com/n/acl-workshops2023](https://softconf.com/n/acl-workshops2023).

The workshop proposals will be evaluated according to their originality and impact, and the quality of the organizing team and Programme Committee. 

## Diversity and Inclusion

The proposals should describe the ways in which the workshop will support diversity in NLP. We suggest organizers consider the following points, while developing the proposal:

- Contribution to academic diversity: The proposals could explain how the subject matter of the workshop will contribute to the diversity of the field, e.g. use of multilingual data, indications of how the described methods scale up to various languages or domains, accessibility of resources, supporting underrepresented communities of NLP and so on.
- Diversifying representation: Following the [WiNLP](http://www.winlp.org/winlp-2020-workshop/) initiative, we recognize the current problems of demographic imbalance in the field. Therefore, we particularly encourage submissions including members of under-represented groups in computational linguistics. The proposals should describe how their selection of invited speakers, panelists, organizers, and program committee promotes diverse representation (for example, considering underrepresented demographics based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, and so on). We also suggest including speakers and panelists, who have not appeared as a keynote speaker or panelist in recent conferences.
- Diversifying participation: The proposals could describe how the call-for-papers and outreach will encourage people from marginalized groups to attend and submit to the workshop. Some examples include providing mentoring, subsidies, coordinating with affinity groups, diversifying the selection of papers and so on.

## Organizer Responsibilities

The organizers of the accepted proposals will be responsible for publicizing and running the workshop, including reviewing submissions, producing the camera-ready workshop proceedings, organizing the meeting days, and playing their part to ensure that all participants are aware of ACL’s anti-harassment policy. It is crucial that organizers commit to all deadlines. In particular, failure to produce the camera-ready proceedings on time will lead to the exclusion of the workshop from the unified proceedings and author indexes. Workshop organizers cannot accept submissions for publication that will be (or have been) published elsewhere, although they are free to set their own policies on simultaneous submission and review. Since the conferences will occur at different times, the timelines for the submission and reviewing of workshop papers, and the preparation of camera-ready copies, will be different for each conference. Suggested timelines for each of the conferences are given below. The workshop organizers should not deviate from this schedule unless absolutely necessary, and with explicit agreement from the relevant Workshop Chairs.

The ACL has a set of policies on workshops. You can find the ACL’s general policies on workshops, the financial policy for workshops, and the financial policy for SIG workshops in the [Conference Handbook](http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Conference_Handbook).
