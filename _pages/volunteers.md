## STUDENT VOLUNTEER PROGRAM

We seek a limited number of student volunteers for the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2022), for both online and in-person versions. In exchange for one full day equivalent of work, students receive free registration to the main conference. Workshops and tutorials are not included and must be paid for by the student. The work will be divided, probably into two half-day shifts, and the shifts will be scheduled to maximize volunteer access to the conference events. Tasks will include assisting at the registration desk, stuffing delegate packs, **helping to maintain social media** (mainly Twitter) and providing assistance for conference events including tutorials, the main conference, and workshops, for either online or in-person versions.

## STUDENT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM

Through the Student Scholarship Program, we will offer a limited number of grants to assist student participants both with travel to Abu Dhabi as well as with conference expenses (such as accommodation, local transportation to/from the airport, conference registration, etc.)

Successful applicants for the Student Scholarship Program must also participate in the Student Volunteer Program (in-person) and will receive free registration to the main conference in addition to their scholarships. Please note that these scholarships are to subsidize student participation in EMNLP 2022, and are not intended to cover all travel and conference expenses. The final amount of the scholarship will vary depending on the number of days of the stay, the cost of the travel, the quantity of money available, and the number and type of applicants.

## SELECTION CRITERIA

Applicants for both the Student Volunteer Program and the Student Scholarship Program will be evaluated based on the material they submit in their application packages (see below for the submission requirements). Preference will be given to students who are presenting a paper (physically) in the main conference or any of the associated workshops and do not have other means of travel support.

## SUBMISSION PROCEDURE

Applicants for either the Student Volunteer Program or the Student Scholarship Program must be full-time students and should submit the application form [here](https://forms.gle/cwvq88ohKtp5t88z6) where we ask a few questions and **a one-page CV**.
