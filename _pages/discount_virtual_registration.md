Discounted/sliding scale virtual registration is intended to make ACL events accessible to researchers who otherwise would be unable to participate. The application form for discounted and free virtual registration will be available on May 30th.  Criteria for selection for financial aid will include your (a) country of residence, (b) employment position, (c) monthly income range, (d) available financial support from your employer/university, and (e) special circumstances.  Given prioritization for those in greatest financial need, except in the case of special circumstances this additional funding is not intended for employed individuals and funded students from USA/Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Australia/New Zealand and higher income countries in Asia. Standard student registration rates (including from these regions) are already substantially discounted.

Given the large real costs of all conference paper presentations (whether virtual or in-person), all papers in the program (oral or poster) must have at least one author who has registered at a minimum at the full conference virtual regular rate of $300, or at the higher appropriate in-person rates if attending in person. If this is prohibitive, please contact the D&I committee.
